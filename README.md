# Borůvka's Algorithm Project

This repository contains the materials for the Borůvka's Algorithm project, including the technical report, source code implementation in Python, and a video demonstration of the algorithm and code execution.

## Project Structure

- `Algorithms_that_Changed_the_World_Report.pdf`: The technical report detailing the principles, pseudo code, complexity analysis, applications, and potential improvements of Borůvka's algorithm.
- `Boruvkas Algorithm.ipynb`: The Python source code implementing Borůvka's algorithm.
- `Video_Demonstration.mp4`: A short video introducing Borůvka's algorithm and demonstrating the code execution (if the video is hosted online, the link will be provided within the report).

## Report Abstract

The report provides an in-depth analysis of Borůvka's algorithm, a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected graph. The principles, execution steps, and pseudo code are thoroughly explained. Additionally, the report includes a complexity analysis, discusses the limitations and constraints, and explores diverse applications of the algorithm in fields such as network design, cluster analysis, and more.

## Implementation

The source code is written in Python and is fully commented to aid understanding. The implementation covers the algorithm's execution following the principles outlined in the report. To run the code, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine and execute the script using a Python interpreter.

## Video Demonstration

The video provides a concise background of Borůvka's algorithm, discusses its importance, and walks through the source code implementation. It also includes a live demonstration of the code running and producing an MST from a sample graph.

## Usage Instructions

1. Read the `Algorithms_that_Changed_the_World_Report.pdf` to understand the theoretical aspects of the algorithm.
2. Review the `Boruvkas Algorithm.ipynb` to familiarize yourself with the implementation details.
3. Run the code in a jupyter notebook or using a Python interpreter.
4. Watch the `Video_Demonstration.mp4` for a guided tour of the project and to see the code demonstration.
